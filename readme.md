## Usage

To use this widget put the `jira_tasks_left.rb` file in your `/jobs` folder.

To include the widget in a dashboard, add the following snippet to the dashboard layout file:
    
    <li data-row="1" data-col="2" data-sizex="1" data-sizey="1">
        <div data-id="jira_tasks_left" data-view="Number" data-title="Tasks left in current sprint"></div>
    </li>

## Settings

You'll need to add the JIRA username and password of a account that is able to access the sprint board. The tasks are fetched every 5 minutes, but you can change that by editing the job schedule.

## Advanced

Use [DashingLongNumberWidget](https://github.com/SocialbitGmbH/DashingLongNumberWidget) if you dont want `1000` tasks displayed as `1K`.

Example:

    <li data-row="1" data-col="2" data-sizex="1" data-sizey="1">
        <div data-id="jira_tasks_left" data-view="Longnumber" data-title="Tasks left in current sprint"></div>
    </li>
